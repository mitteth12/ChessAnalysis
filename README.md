# Road to 1500 Rating on Chess.com
A repository to hold my chess data as I attempt to get to 1500 rating on Chess.com. This data will follow alongside lessons I will be taking to improve my chess ability. There are 120 video lessons and for every 20 episodes a reference line will be put in to see if any trends follow. All visualizations will be done in Tableau.
